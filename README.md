# Overview

This repository provides the necessary factory file that implements the Optimization of OT problems using Riemannian Manifold Optimization Framework.
Details can be found in our work:

Bamdev Mishra, N. T. V. Satya Dev, Hiroyuki Kasai, Pratik Jawanpuria. [Manifold Optimization for Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00902), arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.00902, 2021.

# Usage

The factory file is compatible with the Manopt toolbox and can be easily integrated by placing it in the `manopt/manifolds/` folder.
